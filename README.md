MyExploration
=============

I did the first app tutorial and the action bar tutorial. Mostly, I experimented with alarms and notifications, with help from some people on the internet because it will be very relevant to my project.

The app has the same functionality as MyFirstApp on the tutorial, but with a settings menu in the action bar. There, you can set a time for the app to notify you with a message that you write.
